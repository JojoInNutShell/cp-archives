Archive of my code to problems on Online Judges :D

Of course you may do anything with this.
Some of the later code have header containing explanation of my approach to the problem (Observation or Idea) but some may not.

The file will be named mostly as follow :

(Online Judge Code)(Problem ID)_(Problem Name)_(Notes).(Extension)

Example : ABC251C_PoemJudgeOnline.cpp

> Sometime the notes is just number indicating another approach, or something like BIT (Means using binary indexed tree)
